3. TESTING STRATEGY

White-Box Testing Approach
White-box testing focuses on the internal structure, code paths, and implementation details:
- Statement Coverage: Ensure every line of code is executed
- Branch Coverage: Test all conditional paths (if/else, switch cases)
- Path Coverage: Test various execution flows through methods
- Exception Handling: Verify proper error handling and exception propagation

Black-Box Testing Approach
Black-box testing focuses on functionality without knowledge of internal implementation:
- Boundary Value Analysis: Test with edge values (zero, negative, maximum)
- Equivalence Partitioning: Group similar inputs and test representatives
- Input Validation: Test with valid and invalid input formats
- Output Verification: Ensure correct results for given inputs
